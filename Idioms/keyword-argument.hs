-- We show the Haskell implementation of keyword arguments, which goes well beyond records (e.g., in permitting the re-use of labels). Keyword arguments indeed look just like regular, positional arguments. However, keyword arguments may appear in any order. Furthermore, one may associate defaults with some keywords; the corresponding arguments may then be omitted. It is a type error to omit a required keyword argument. The latter property is in stark contrast with the conventional way of emulating keyword arguments via records. Also in marked contrast with records, keyword labels may be reused throughout the code with no restriction; the same label may be associated with arguments of different types in different functions. Labels of Haskell records may not be re-used. Our solution is essentially equivalent to keyword arguments of DSSSL Scheme or labels of OCaml.

    We show the Haskell implementation of keyword arguments, which goes
    well beyond records (e.g., in permitting the re-use of
    labels). Keyword arguments indeed look just like regular, positional
    arguments. However, keyword arguments may appear in any
    order. Furthermore, one may associate defaults with some keywords; the
    corresponding arguments may then be omitted. It is a type error to
    omit a required keyword argument. The latter property is in stark
    contrast with the conventional way of emulating keyword arguments via
    records. Also in marked contrast with records, keyword labels may be
    reused throughout the code with no restriction; the same label may be
    associated with arguments of different types in different
    functions. Labels of Haskell records may not be re-used.  Our solution
    is essentially equivalent to keyword arguments of DSSSL Scheme or
    labels of OCaml.

    Keyword argument functions are naturally polyvariadic: Haskell does
    support varargs! Keyword argument functions may be polymorphic. As
    usual, functions with keyword arguments may be partially applied. On
    the downside, sometimes one has to specify the type of the return
    value of the function (if the keyword argument function has no
    signature -- the latter is the norm, see below) -- provided that the
    compiler cannot figure the return type out on its own. This is usually
    only the case when we use keyword functions at the top level (GHCi
    prompt).

    Our solution requires no special extensions to Haskell and works with
    the existing Haskell compilers; it is tested on GHC 6.0.1. The
    overlapping instances extension is not necessary (albeit it is
    convenient).

    The gist of our implementation is the realization that the type of a
    function is a polymorphic collection of its argument types -- a
    collection that we can traverse. This message thus illustrates a
    limited form of the reflection on a function.


    Our implementation is a trivial extension of the strongly-typed
    polymorphic open records described in
        http://homepages.cwi.nl/~ralf/HList/

    In fact, the implementation relies on the HList library.  To run the
    code (which this message is), one needs to download the HList library
    from the above site.

    The HList paper discusses the issue of labels in some detail. The
    paper gives three different representations. One of them needs no
    overlapping instances and is very portable. In this message, we chose
    a representation that relies on generic type equality and therefore
    needs overlapping instances as implemented in GHC. Again, this is
    merely an outcome of our non-deterministic choice. It should be
    emphasized that other choices are possible, which do not depend on 
    overlapping instances at all. Please see the HList paper for details.

    We will be using an example inspired by a graphics toolkit -- the area
    which really benefits from keyword arguments. We first define our
    labels and useful datatypes

    > data Color = Color
    > data Size  = Size
    > data Origin  = Origin
    > data RaisedBorder = RaisedBorder
    >
    > data CommonColor = Red | Green | Blue deriving Show
    > data RGBColor = RGBColor Int Int Int deriving Show

    and two functions:

    > make_square Size n Origin (x0,y0) Color (color::CommonColor) =
    >   unwords ["Square:", show n, "at", show (x0,y0), show color] ++ "\n"
    > 
    > make_rect Size (nx,ny) Origin (x0,y0) Color (color::RGBColor)
    > 	 RaisedBorder border =
    >   unwords ["Rectangle:", show (nx,ny), "at", show (x0,y0),
    > 	   show color, if border then "raised border" else ""] ++ "\n"


    We are not interested in really drawing squares and rectangles
    here. Therefore, make_square and make_rect return a String, which we
    can regard as a ``command'' to be passed to a low-level graphics
    library. The functions make_square and make_rect are genuine functions
    and can be used as such. They are not keyword argument functions, yet,
    but they set the stage. These functions can be considered an
    `interface' for the keyword argument functions. We should note that
    the functions are polymorphic: for example, `Size' can be any
    showable. We must also emphasize the re-use of the labels: The Color
    of a square is the value of the enumerated type CommonColor. OTH, the
    color of the rectangle is given as an RGB triple. The sizes of the
    square and of the rectangle are specified differently too, the same
    label notwithstanding.

    Once the user wrote the functions such as make_square and make_rect,
    he can _automatically_ convert them to their keyword
    alternatives. This transformation is done by a function 'kw'. The user
    should pass the positional-argument function (`labeled' as above),
    and an HList of default values for some of the labels. The latter may
    be HNil if all keyword arguments are required.

    The first example (no defaults)

    > tests1 :: String = 
    >     kw make_square HNil Size (1::Int) Origin (0::Int,10::Int) Color Red 
        
    we can permute the arguments at wish

    > tests2 :: String = 
    >     kw make_square HNil Color Red Size (1::Int) Origin (0::Int,10::Int)  
        
    we can also assign a name to a keyword function, or partially apply it:

    > tests3 = let f x = kw make_square HNil Color Red x
    > 	   in "here: " ++ f Origin (0::Int,10::Int) Size (1::Int) 
        
    The dummy argument 'x' is merely to avoid the monomorphic
    restriction. The following is a more interesting example, with the
    defaults:

    > tests4 = let defaults = Origin .*. (0::Int,10::Int) .*.
    > 			  RaisedBorder .*. True .*.
    > 			  HNil
    > 	   in kw make_square defaults Size (1::Int) Color Red ++
    > 	      kw make_rect   defaults Color (RGBColor 0 10 255)
    > 	                              Size (1.0::Float, 2.0::Float)

    The argument RaisedBorder is not given, and so the default value is
    used. Of course, we can override the default:

    > tests5 = let defaults = Origin .*. (0::Int,10::Int) .*.
    > 			  RaisedBorder .*. True .*.
    > 			  HNil
    > 	       sq x = kw make_square defaults Color x
    > 	       re x = kw make_rect   defaults x
    > 	   in sq Red Size (1::Int) ++
    > 	      re Color (RGBColor 0 10 255)
    > 	         RaisedBorder False
    > 	         Size (1.0::Float, 2.0::Float)

    We have reshuffled a few arguments, just for fun. As you can see, the
    function `kw make_rect defaults' is polyvariadic indeed.  We chose to
    partially apply 'Color' to the function `kw make_square defaults' --
    so that the function `sq' is positional in its first argument, and
    keyword in the rest.

    If we omit a required argument, we get a type error:

    ] testse1 = let f x = kw make_square HNil Color Red x
    ] 	    in "here: " ++ f Origin (0::Int,10::Int) 

    Couldn't match `ErrReqdArgNotFound Size' against `[Char]'
        Expected type: ErrReqdArgNotFound Size
        Inferred type: [Char] ...

    The error message seems reasonably clear. Likewise we get an error
    message if we pass to a keyword function an argument it does not expect:

    ] testse2 = let f x = kw make_square HNil Color Red x
    ] 	    in "here: " ++ f Origin (0::Int,10::Int) Size (1::Int) 
    ]	                   RaisedBorder False

    No instances for (Fail (ErrUnexpectedKW RaisedBorder),
                KWApply [Char] (HCons RaisedBorder (:*: Bool HNil)) [Char])
        arising from use of `f' at ...
        In the second argument of `(++)', namely
        `f Origin (0 :: Int, 10 :: Int) Size (1 :: Int) RaisedBorder False'


    The function 'kw' receives the appropriately labeled function (such
    as make_square) and the HList with default values. The function 'kw'
    is polymorphic; the overloading is resolved based on the type of the
    user function *and* on the type of its continuation. The continuation
    indicates if a keyword argument is forthcoming, or not. In the latter
    case, 'kw' checks to see if the supplied defaults can provide the
    values of the still missing arguments. We see therefore that a
    function type is more than it may appear -- the type of a function is
    truly a heterogeneous, type level collection! The function 'kw'
    traverses that collection, thus performing a limited form of
    reflection on Haskell functions.
    

    Implementation Outline

    One of the key tools of the implementation is 'kwapply', which applies
    a function to a polymorphic collection of that function's arguments.
    The order of the arguments in the collection is irrelevant. The
    contraption kwapply can handle polymorphic functions with arbitrary
    number of labeled arguments.

    For example, if we define

    > f1 Size n = show n
    > f2 Size n Color m = unwords ["size:", show n, "color:", show m]
    > f3 Origin x Color m Size n = 
    >     unwords ["origin:", show x, "size:", show n, "color:",show m]

    then we can run

    > katest1  = kwapply f1 (Size .*. () .*. HNil)
    > katest11 = kwapply f1 (Size .*. "Large" .*. HNil)
    > 
    > katest2  = kwapply f2 (Size .*. (1::Int) .*. Color .*. Red .*. HNil)
    > katest21 = kwapply f2 (Color .*. Red .*. Size .*. (1::Int) .*.  HNil)
    > 
    > katest3  = kwapply f3 (Size .*. (1::Int) .*. Origin .*. (2.0::Float) .*. 
    > 		         Color .*. Red .*. HNil)

    Another key contraption is 

    > reflect_fk:: (ReflectFK fn kws) => fn -> Arg kws HNil
    > reflect_fk _ = Arg HNil

    that reflects on a user-supplied function. It converts the *type* of a
    user function to a collection of keywords required by that
    function. This and the previous contraptions may be used to define an
    `extended' version of some user function that takes more arguments --
    without the need to enumerate all arguments of the original
    function. We thus infringe on the area of object and module systems.

    The rest of the implementation is just to convert `kw fn defaults' 
    into the application of kwapply. 



    The rest of the implementation

    We should note that all implementation is written in the
    continuation-passing style (CPS) -- at the term level and especially
    at the _typeclass level_. One of the reasons is to avoid relying on
    overlapping instances: we compare types with a predicate `TypeEq x y
    hbool', obtain the type-level boolean, and dispatch to two
    non-overlapping instances of an auxiliary, continuation class. One
    instance handles HTrue, and the other the HFalse alternative. Please
    see the HList paper for more discussion of this technique.

    The other, equally important reason for the thorough CPS of the
    typeclasses is to control the order of evaluation of constraints and
    their functional dependencies. The sole reason is to produce
    informative error messages. The order of constraints is irrelevant
    when all the constraints are satisfied. However, if the user omitted a
    required keyword, many of the constraints below will fail. If a
    'wrong' constraint fails first, we get a totally off-the-wall error
    message that gives us no clue whatsoever about the problem. By tightly
    constraining the order via CPS, we are able to force the typechecker
    to give informative error messages.

    The datatype Arg below is to maintain the state of keyword
    accumulation: which keywords we need, and which keyword and values we
    have already got.
    arg_types is the phantom HList of keywords that are yet to be satisfied.
    arg_values is the HList (kw .*. kw_value .*. etc)
    of already found keywords and their values.

    > newtype Arg arg_types arg_values = Arg arg_values deriving Show

    Reflection on a function:
    Given a function, return the type list of its keywords

    > class ReflectFK f kws | f -> kws
    > instance (IsKeyFN f flag, ReflectFK' flag f kws) => ReflectFK f kws
    > class ReflectFK' flag f kws | flag f -> kws
    > instance ReflectFK rest kws => ReflectFK' HTrue (kw->a->rest) (HCons kw kws)
    > instance ReflectFK' HFalse f HNil

    -- :t reflect_fk (undefined::Size->Int->Color->CommonColor->String)
    -- :t reflect_fk (undefined::Size->Int->()->Int)

    The main class: collect and apply the keyword arguments

    > class KW f arg_desc arg_def r where
    >     kwdo :: f -> arg_desc -> arg_def -> r
    > 
    > instance (IsKeyFN r rflag, -- Fail (Trace (arg_desc,r)),
    > 	    KW' rflag f arg_desc arg_def r)
    >     => KW f arg_desc arg_def r where
    >     kwdo = kw' (undefined::rflag)
    > 
    > class KW' rflag f arg_desc arg_def r where
    >     kw' :: rflag -> f -> arg_desc -> arg_def -> r

    If the continuation r does not promise any more keyword
    arguments, apply the defaults

    > instance KWMerge arg_needed arg_values arg_def f r
    >     => KW' HFalse f (Arg arg_needed arg_values) arg_def r where
    >     kw' _ f args_given arg_def = kwmerge args_given arg_def f

    Otherwise, collect the supplied keyword and its value, and recurse for
    more:

    > instance KWAcc arg_desc kw a f arg_def r
    >     => KW' HTrue f arg_desc arg_def (kw->a->r) where
    >     kw' _ f arg_desc arg_def kw a = kwaccum arg_desc kw a f arg_def


    Add the needed arguments from arg_def to arg_values and continue
    with kwapply.
    That is, we try to satisfy the missing arguments from the defaults.
    It will be a type error if some required arguments are missing

    > class KWMerge arg_needed arg_values arg_def f r |
    >               arg_needed arg_values arg_def f -> r  where

    >                  atail arg_values arg_def f r where
    >     kwmerge'' _ kw (HCons _ (HCons _ tail)) = kwmerge' kw tail

    Add the real argument to the Arg structure, and continue

    > class KWAcc arg_desc kw a f arg_def r where

    Delete e from l to yield l' The element e must occur in l

    Finally,
